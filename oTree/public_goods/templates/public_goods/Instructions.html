    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group
        of 2 participants. Each participant in
        the group is given {{ Constants.endowment }}. The group
        has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in
        the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0
        to {{ Constants.endowment }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
        contributions of all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants are
        added up, then the total contribution
        is multiplied by a factor which depends on the ranking of both participants as derived from the first Task. The
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all participants in the group. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus
        the amount you did not contribute.
