    <p>
        Now you are going to be asked to choose between the following pair of alternatives. Choose which one you prefer from each pair, an algorithm will randomly pick one pair and your payment of this stage will depend upon what you have chosen. On the left hand side you can see a lottery that gives the chance to win 100 credits with increasing probability; if chosen, the software will randomly pick a number and pay you with the given probability. On the right hand side you can decide to compare your result with that of a randomly chosen participant. If you performed better you receive 100 credit points, otherwise he receives the credit points, which are going to be converted into Euros at the end of the experiment.
