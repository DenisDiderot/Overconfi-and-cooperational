	<p> For what concerns the first task, the choice set number {{ random_choice }} has been selected. Here your choice was the {{ choice }} and you gained {{ payoff_elicit }}.</p>
    <p> In the second task, the round which has been selected is {{ random_public}}, meaning that the payment for this task is {{ payoff_public}}.</p>
    <p> Therefore the overall payment is {{ player.payoff }}, which is equivalent to {{ final }} (as the conversion rate was 1 token = 0.05€ and the show-up fee was 4€).</p>
